**Project Summary**
Our project is a group chat application that allows users to join and interact in interest-based groups. Users can create groups, discover new ones, and communicate with others who share similar interests. The application includes features like user authentication, group management, and messaging to enhance social engagement.


**Run Intructions**
Once downloaded, locate the SocialApp file in the directory src\main\java
Once the file is selected, run the file through gradle, our app uses gradle resources and thus will not work with the default launch option
